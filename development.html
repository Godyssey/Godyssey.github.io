					I believe some strengths I developed over the last few years are

					<dl>
						<dt><font color="#BFA084" face="Courier New">Persistence |</font></dt>
						<dd>
							I have learnt that being tenacious with my beliefs & actions
							shows others my will to continue my efforts in achieving the
							goals I've set out for myself. Refusing to shy away from
							challenges has helped me a lot to keep pushing in times of struggle.</br>
						</dd>
						<dt><font color="#BFA084" face="Courier New">Rational Thinking |</font></dt>
						<dd>
							As of recent, I realized that observing the situation before
							speaking on it has helped a lot in de-escalating what could
							have become a lot worse due to a misunderstanding. Since I've
							come to terms with my ill-temper, I use this not only to keep
							disagreements civil but to remain calm on my own behalf.</br>
						</dd>
						<dt><font color="#BFA084" face="Courier New">Strong Listener |</font></dt>
						<dd>
							I've had this trait for some time now; I enjoy listening to my 
							friends' problems whether they wish to rant or gain advice.
							Giving someone a listening ear in a time of need is always a 
							great way to show someone you care & I learnt that relating to
							them helps them to be more comfortable expressing themselves.</br>

					Chapters 4 to 7 of <i>Twelve Pillars</i> have explored the importance of
					setting goals for yourself and close observation of not only
					yourself but the ones around you. As Michael learns of Mr. David's 
					Twelve Pillars of success through Charlie, he begins to think more 
					strategically about his life goals, his friends, associations and 
					those he aspires to be like. It becomes quite the eye opener for 
					him when faced with the realization of limiting relations or 
					outright disassociating from the companionship he's had for years 
					& that books can be the gateway to success he's strived to reach.<br>
					Although I have never written my goals down, I have a clear vision
					of what I want from myself. However, I am not opposed to the idea
					of setting more fleshed out, meaningful goals for myself. I think
					I would benefit greatly from the reminder of what I aim to achieve
					for myself. I also believe being more observant of my friends &
					their attitude towards their lives will aid significantly in
					whether keeping them as close as they are currently is in my best 
					interests.
